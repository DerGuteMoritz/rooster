Requires linux + epoll at the moment.
I'd like to fallback to poll if epoll isn't available.

Run make to generate rooster.so

    $ make

To use rooster.so:

    (require 'rooster)

    (define (handler fd rbuf)
        ;; echo input back to client
        (send-to-client fd rbuf))

    ;; pass handler to rooster
    (run-rooster handler)
