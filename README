This is for Version 0.1 and will not apply to future versions of Rooster.

Rooster is a server built in Chicken Scheme.
Rooster makes use of the epoll egg that I wrote (http://github.com/davidreynolds/epoll) to handle socket events.

Requires linux + epoll at the moment.
I'd like to fallback to poll if epoll isn't available.

Run make to generate rooster.so

    $ make

To use rooster.so:

    (require 'rooster)

    (define (handler fd rbuf)
        ;; echo input back to client
        (send-to-client fd rbuf))

    ;; pass handler to rooster
    (run-rooster handler)

To run the examples, make rooster and then do:

    $ csi examples/echo/echo.scm

You'll then be dropped into the Chicken Scheme Interpreter and from another shell prompt
you can

    $ telnet localhost 6666
